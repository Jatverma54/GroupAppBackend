**GroupApp Backend**
GroupApp Backend is the server-side application for the GroupApp social media platform. It is built using microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. The backend handles user authentication, group management, real-time notifications, and more.

**Architecture**
**MongoDB**: For database management.
**Node.js**: For server-side logic.
**Expo**: For sending real-time notifications.
**AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: For deployment and scaling

**Microservices**
The backend is divided into several microservices, each responsible for a specific functionality:

User Service: Manages user authentication and profiles.
Group Service: Handles group creation, management, and membership.
Post Service: Manages posts and comments within groups.
Notification Service: Sends real-time notifications using Expo.
Gateway Service: Acts as an API gateway to route requests to the appropriate microservice.
